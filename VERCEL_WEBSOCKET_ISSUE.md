# ❌ Vercel WebSocket Issue - Quick Fix Guide

## The Problem

Your poker game is failing on Vercel because **Vercel doesn't support WebSocket connections** needed for real-time multiplayer gaming.

Error you're seeing:

```
WebSocket connection to 'wss://holdem-poker-nextjs.vercel.app/api/socket/' failed
```

## ✅ Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Move to Railway.app (Recommended - 5 minutes)

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your poker repo
5. Set environment variables:
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.railway.app`
6. Deploy - your WebSockets will work immediately!

### Option 2: Move to Render.com (Free alternative)

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Connect GitHub account
3. Create new "Web Service"
4. Build command: `npm install && npm run build`
5. Start command: `npm start`

### Option 3: Keep Vercel (Limited functionality)

Your app will work with basic HTTP polling (not real-time), but it's not ideal for poker.

## ⚡ Quick Test

After deploying to Railway/Render, open browser dev tools and you should see:

```
✅ Connected to socket server
```

Instead of:

```
❌ WebSocket connection failed
```
